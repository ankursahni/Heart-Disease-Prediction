# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Analyzing the pre-processed cleveland dataset to predict the whether the person has a Heart Disease or Not (ignoring the severity)

Dataset Contains 14 Features or Attributes to understand the dataset more clearly.
1.  Age: Between 35 to 75 (in years).
2.  Sex: 1 = "Male" and 0 = "Female".
3.  CP : Chest Pain type
      Value 1 = Typical angina
      Value 2 = atypical angina
      Value 3 = non angina pain
      Value 4 = asymptotic
4.  Trestbps – (resting blood pressure)
5.  chol: Serum cholesterol 
6.  fbs : If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl (1 =true else : 0 = false)
7.  restecg : resting electrocardiographic results
      0 = normal 
      1 = having ST-T wave abnormality 
      2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
8:  thalach: maximum heart rate achieved.
9.  exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes and 0 = no)
10. Oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest: 
11. Slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
      1 = upsloping
      2 = flat
      3 = downsloping 
12. ca: Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by flourosopy. 
13. Thal : 3 = normal 6 = fixed defect 7 = reversible defect 
14. Diagnosis of heart disease : 0 = absence 1, 2, 3, 4 = present(taken whole as "1").
